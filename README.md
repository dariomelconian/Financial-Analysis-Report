This is the final group report project for SS 4960, Business Skills for Data Scientists, at Western University.

The objective was to conduct a full financial analyses for the purpose of potential investment opportunity, having been assigned to compare duopoly companies Coca-Cola and Pepsico. 

The form has a standard approach to such analyses, which include the following for both companies:
